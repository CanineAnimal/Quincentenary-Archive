			<H1 ID="HEADER">Welcome To The Quincentenary Archive</H1>
			<BR/>
			<P>The Quincentenary Archive is a sophisticated, <A HREF="https://github.com/CanineAnimal/Quincentenary-Archive">open-source</A> archive of threads in the <A HREF="https://forum.nationstates.net/viewforum.php?f=25">Forum 7</A> board that have fallen into disuse or reached the page limit, as prior to their deletion. Archives prior to mid-2022 may be woefully incomplete. As all archivals are manual, you must request an archival to me (<A HREF="https://www.nationstates.net/nation=the_ice_states">The Ice States</A>), preferably by telegram. Archives prior to August 2022 are obtained from <A HREF="https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1543370">"Project Langolier-Proofing"</A>,  created by Valentine Z. I thank them for this contribution. Please also find this project's forum thread <A HREF="https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=523677">here</A>; this is a twin project of the Martial Repositories, which you may find <A HREF="https://canineanimal.github.io/The-Martial-Repositories/pages/">here</A>.</P>

				<H2>HTML Archive</H2>
				<BR/>
				<P>The HTML Archive saves each page of a thread in webpage format. Spoilers are usable in the HTML Archive. Links are displayed, but links between pages of now-deleted threads will be dysfunctional if the archive was made before mid-May 2023. In addition, linked pages and images are not themselves saved -- older archives may therefore be woefully unformatted or contain dead links.</P>

				<BR/>
				<H2>PDF Archive</H2>
				<BR/>
				<P>The PDF Archive saves each page of a thread in PDF format. No formatting is lost, as images and formatting are copied onto the PDF archive. Links are also kept, although they may be dead or link to pages that no longer exist. Links between pages of now-deleted threads will be dysfunctional if the archive was made before mid-May 2023. Spoilers will not function.</P>

				<BR/>
				<H2>Link Search</H2>
				<BR/>
				<P>If you have a link to a Forum 7 thread, page or post, the Link Search tool will search to see if that link is archived in the HTML Archives, and if it is, open that link in the HTML Archives.</P>
				<BR/>
				Enter link: <INPUT ID="LINK_SEARCH"/> <BUTTON ONCLICK="searchLink()">GO!</BUTTON>

			<DIV ID="JSONABOX" CLASS="ABOX">
				<BR/>
				<H2>JSON Archive</H2>
				<BR/>
				<P>The JSON Archive forms a singular database of each thread saved. This archive is intended to be computer-readable, but not for raw human reading. Enter at the peril of your sanity.</P>
