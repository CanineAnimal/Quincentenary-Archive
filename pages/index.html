			<H1 ID="HEADER">Welcome To The Quincentenary Archive</H1>
			<BR/>
			<P>This is an <A HREF="https://github.com/CanineAnimal/Quincentenary-Archive">open-source</A> archive of threads in the <A HREF="https://forum.nationstates.net/viewforum.php?f=25">Forum 7</A> board that have fallen into disuse or reached the page limit, as prior to their deletion. As all archivals are manual, you must request an archival to me (<A HREF="https://www.nationstates.net/nation=the_ice_states">The Ice States</A>) by telegram or in the relevant forum thread. Archives prior to September 2022 may be woefully incomplete.</P>

					<P>The HTML Archive saves each page of a thread in webpage format. Spoilers are usable in the HTML Archive. Links are displayed, but links between pages of a now-deleted threads will be dysfunctional. In addition, linked pages and images are not themselves saved -- older archives may therefore be woefully unformatted or contain dead links.</P>

					<H2>PDF Archive</H2>
					<BR/>
					<P>The PDF Archive saves each page of a thread in PDF format. No formatting is lost, as images and formatting are copied onto the PDF archive, and links will also function, though they may be dead or link to pages that no longer exist. However, spoilers will not function. Archives prior to 2022 are obtained from <A HREF="https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1543370">"Project Langolier-Proofing"</A> -- thank you to Valentine Z for making this happen.</P>

					<P>The JSON Archive forms a singular database of each thread saved. This archive is intended to be computer-readable, but not for raw human reading. Enter at the peril of your sanity.</P>
