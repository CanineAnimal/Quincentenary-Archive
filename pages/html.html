			<P>The HTML Archive saves each page of a thread in webpage format. Spoilers are usable in the HTML Archive. Links are displayed, but links between pages of now-deleted threads will be dysfunctional if the archive was made before mid-May 2023. In addition, linked pages and images are not themselves saved -- older archives may therefore be woefully unformatted or contain dead links. Archives prior to 2022 are obtained from <A HREF="https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1543370">"Project Langolier-Proofing"</A> -- thank you to Valentine Z for making this happen.</P>
