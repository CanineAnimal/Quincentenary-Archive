# Quincentenary-Archive
For archiving threads on the Forum 7 board that reach the maximum page limit.

Maintained by CanineAnimal (The Ice States on NationStates).

Archives prior to August 2022 are obtained from ["Project Langolier-Proofing"](https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1543370), created by the amazing Valentine Z.

The build can be accessed [here](https://canineanimal.github.io/Quincentenary-Archive/pages/).

Please note that this repository only contains source code. The actual archives, except for the JSON Archive, are in the repostiory ["QA-Archives"](https://github.com/CanineAnimal/QA-Archives). Archives prior to mid-2022 may be woefully incomplete.

In addition, while threads will, of course, be archived within seven days, threads are uploaded to QA-Archives in batches whenever I feel like it. That a thread is not uploaded does not necessarily mean that I have not saved it -- feel free to ask me if you want to know whether I have saved a thread.
